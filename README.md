# PyTorch implementation of the Growing Neural Cellular Automata
Neural cellular automata that learns to "grow" into a target picture. It uses the same update rule for all pixels and each pixel uses only the local information of surrounding pixels. Further details in the Distill paper [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/).
